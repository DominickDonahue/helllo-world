our goal is to create a game where the challenge is finding out how
you achieved your goal, not how to achieve it

give a pretty simple goal

"You're plahing, one on ONE, with the BIG MAN"
"iT'S TIME to catchc . . . some UNREAL AIR"
"put that rock through the hoop"

there will be three checks
1. check input.length
2. check the number of vowels in the input, give them scores
3. check for a random string within the command
